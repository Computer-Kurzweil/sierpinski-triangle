**a fractal with self self-similarity**

## Abstract

The Sierpiński triangle (sometimes spelled Sierpinski),
also called the Sierpiński gasket or Sierpiński sieve, is a fractal attractive fixed set with the
overall shape of an equilateral triangle, subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles.

Originally constructed as a curve, this is one of the basic examples of self-similar sets—that is,
it is a mathematically generated pattern that is reproducible at any magnification or reduction.

It is named after the Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński, but appeared as a decorative pattern
many centuries before the work of Sierpiński.
